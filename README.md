# CompositionalGVFs
This repository contains the code for Compositional GVFs on the Cycle World and Gridworld environments. 

We use TD(0) to learn the Compositional GVFs. In **Cycle World**, we use the observation as cumulant.

In **Gridworld**, we use the reward as cumulant to learn the first GVF.
